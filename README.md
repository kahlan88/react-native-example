# Install

This is a project using Expo for testing on a local mobile device. If you'd like to use Android Emulator have a cd to the `sim` directory.

## Prerequisites

On your Android / iOS phone install `Expo Go` app. No need to sign up.

Run cmd:
`npm start`

In the Expo app scan the QR code.

Or use in-build phone camera to scan the code.

## Android Simulator
Go to `sim` folder & follow the readme there.

## Troubleshooting

If the above steps don't work, you may need to change your firewall settings and make sure that the process on port 19000 (node) is allowed. You might need to set it in ESET under security and local rule for port 19000.

(Debugging issues)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59658998/expo-unable-to-resolve-module-debugger]. The errors appear in the terminal, but the app works fine and refreshes fine too.
